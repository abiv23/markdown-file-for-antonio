# SEO and Development skillset for Modern Technical SEO

## Modern SEO and Google

1. RankBrain.

   Google gets user interaction data from the Chrome Browser and Android devices [CruX](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/chrome-ux-report-dashboard).  

   The [amount of time on site](https://moz.com/blog/long-click-and-the-quality-of-search-success), the amount of pages viewed, bounce rate, exit % are all a part of RankBrain.

   UI/UX data tracking and A/B testing is important in the above, [I have experience in both](https://andrew-biv.com/seo.html).

2. PageSpeed is a major concern, understanding it intimately is a requisite to be successful in SEO.  

   I've found that leveraging server side rendering, hosting your own fonts with a display swap, using CSS modules, and lazy-loading render blocking JS are all major factors in your page speed score.

   As an example my PSI score is a ~56 for my portfolio site in [HTML/CSS/JS](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fandrew-biv.com)

   My PSI score is a ~96 for the same site built in [Gatsby/React/JSX/ModularSCSS](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fabiv.surge.sh%2F)

3. Google hired an SEO back in 2015.

   In the [job description](https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2015/07/google-seo-job.png) they mention an ability to maintain and develop websites as well as CS degree equivalent knowledge, I have worked since then to add those skills and continue to do so.

## How I hope to use these dual skillsets at MapQuest

1. Improving pagespeed.

   DoubleClick by Google found [53% of mobile site visits were abandoned if a page took longer than 3 seconds to load.](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters)

   At Zicasso I worked with a team of two other developers to change our PSI score from a 50 to a 99.

2. Being a resource to the Development team as an SEO expert and debugging difficult SEO issues.

   I was able to locate a de-indexing issue on Zicasso due to my dual skillset.  An IP blocking script was accidentally including Googlebot I found this using Google Search Console and the offending script was removed.  I also stay up to date on SEO trends and can disseminate that info to other Engineers as needed.

3. Updating or removing [older SEO strategies hurting ranking](https://northcutt.com/seo-checklist/google-ranking-factors/).

* [Doorway Pages](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721311?hl=en)

   [ex. on MapQuest](https://www.mapquest.com/directions/to/us/ca/san-francisco-282039201), the search term was 'Los Angeles to San Francisco driving directions'.

* [Longer URLs](https://www.stephanspencer.com/matt-cutts-interview/)

  [ex. on MapQuest](https://www.mapquest.com/directions/list/1/us/ca/los-angeles-282039899/to/us/ca/san-diego-282038949)

* [Slower websites will not rank as well](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.ca/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html)

   [ex. on MapQuest PSI score of 15](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mapquest.com%2F)

4. Emphasizing better landing pages.

   MapQuests 'embedded' pages [tend to outrank the driving direction pages](https://www.google.com/search?q=los+angelos+to+san+diego+driving+directions&pws=0).

   Initial research suggests this is due to external links to these embedded pages, 301 redirecting the poorer user result page to the prime direction 'from to' page will result in a better user experience and more 'rank juice' for the core content.

## Why I want to work for System1/MapQuest

   I have grown traffic here in the past as Sr Product Manager of SEO.  I know the product and believe I can help it grow again. I would also have the opportunity to work with people who have mentored me and shown interest in helping me achieve my goals of becoming a full-stack engineer on an enterprise level web app.
